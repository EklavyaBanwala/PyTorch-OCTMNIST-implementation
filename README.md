# PyTorch-OCTMNIST-implementation
Explored real-world dataset from reputable sources, conducted comprehensive data analysis and preprocessing. Explored PyTorch for neural network building, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. Worked with OCTMNIST dataset, preprocessed data, and designed neural network architecture with techniques to prevent overfitting. Discussed results including training/validation accuracy, loss, and evaluation metrics like precision and recall.
